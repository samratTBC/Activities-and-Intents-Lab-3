# Activities-and-Intents-Lab-3


The exercise provided here deals with recyclerview and adapters. Two main activities are used here, where intent is used inorder to switch screen. The first screen, shows 
the letters that can be chosen which will trigger onClickListener as each of the word is shown in the button. Once clicked the startActivity is called which switches the
current activity to the word activity. The word activity shows random 5 words list that is shown in the new activity. From the word screen once chosen the words, an intent is 
passed which triggers the opening of chrome website that searches the specific word clicked from the activity in the google.
